Helping Drivers with Hearing Impairments Visually See Emergency Vehicle Sirens
The act of driving a car requires the driver to be aware of the road and vehicles around them not only visually but also aurally. Often times, a driver will hear the sirens of an emergency vehicle before they even notice the flashing lights, and a car honk doesn’t even give any visual cues. Most people grow used to having sirens tell them that they should slow down or pull over; however, for somebody who has a hearing impairment or disability, auditory signals can’t be directly used, adding an element of unnecessary risk for these drivers. The purpose of the Hearing Car device would be to take auditory inputs from the surrounding environment and translate them into a visual output so that a person with hearing impairments can be visually alerted when a car honks or when an emergency vehicle’s sirens are on. The final device would look like an aftermarket product that anybody can easily place inside their vehicles and use.
